In a theme park, the ticket price depends on the visitor’s height. 
If the height is less than 120 cm, the person is considered a child and pays ₹50. 
If the height is between 120 cm and 180 cm, they are charged as an adult and pay ₹100.
For people taller than 180 cm, the park gives a special discount ticket of ₹80.
This shows how conditional statements (if, elif, and else) help us make multiple decisions 
based on different conditions, just like in real life.


python code :=
height = int(input("Enter your height in cm: "))

if height < 120:
    print("You pay ₹50 (child ticket).")
elif height <= 180:
    print("You pay ₹100 (adult ticket).")
else:
    print("You pay ₹80 (special discount ticket).")
