"""
# modulo operator 

- The modulo operator in Python is written as %.
- It gives the remainder when one number is divided by another.
# syntax :
result = a % b
- Here, a is the dividend, b is the divisor, and result is the remainder.
# Examples :
print(10 % 3)   # 1  (10 divided by 3 = 3 remainder 1)
print(25 % 7)   # 4  (25 divided by 7 = 3 remainder 4)
print(8 % 2)    # 0  (8 is divisible by 2)
print(7 % 8)    # 7  (dividend < divisor, remainder is the dividend)


# With negative numbers:
- Pythons % always gives a remainder with the same sign as the divisor:
# example2 
print(10 % -3)   # -2
print(-10 % 3)   # 2
